    <p id="p_id">The panda is one of the oldest animals in the world. They are funny and cute and have long been loved by adults and children alike.
        Pandas live exclusively in the mountain forests of China. In length, the panda bear reaches almost 2 meters, the length of the tail is up to 12 cm. 
        It weighs up to 120 kg. These cute bears live in captivity up to 25 years, in the wild are little studied, but scientists agree on the figure of 14-16 years. 
       To describe the panda can be quite simple: a large body covered with thick fur, short thick paws, on which powerful strong nails. Outwardly, the panda is very similar
        to a bear, but the body structure was questioned by scientists, and the panda was placed then in the bear family, then in its own special family and even in the raccoon family.   
       The lesser red panda is a rare crepuscular mammal found in China,
         northern Burma, Bhutan, Nepal and northeastern India. They are rather small creatures, with
          dimensions comparable to a domestic cat: body length - 50-64 cm, tail length - 28-48 cm, and weight - about 5 kg. 
          Small pandas live on average 8-10 years.</p>

    <p id="p_id2">The Northern Lights, or aurora (Aurora Borealis), is an optical phenomenon in which the upper layer of a planet's atmosphere glows with green, red,
        yellow, blue, and violet colors . In the Southern Hemisphere, such as Australia, this phenomenon can also be observed, it is called the Southern Lights.
        Lights at the North and South Poles are also called polar lights. The Northern Lights are more popular among tourists, as they can be observed in more accessible places.    
        Mikhail Lomonosov was the first to reveal the nature of this phenomenon . The aurora borealis is caused by the collision of the Earth's magnetosphere with
        the solar wind. Especially bright aurora can be observed after solar flares, when a whole cloud of charged particles is released.</p>
